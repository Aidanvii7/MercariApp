    These IDs are used as unique IDs when 'tracking' callbacks passed to binding adapters.
    However the same technique can be used to track anything passed to a binding adapter.
    Tracking in this context, is the essentially the ability to store and retrieve values passed into a binding adapter, directly inside the view as a keyed tag.
    This allows us to react only to new values passed into a binding adapter, and do any relevant clean up required for the previous value - if any.
    This is particularly useful for binding adapters used in recycled views.
